    /*
     * Devs at AMZ are working on a new sorting algorithm for points on the x-axis
     * of the coordinate system.
     * 
     * There are n points. The ith point initially has a weight of weight[i] and is
     * located at position i on the x-axis. In a single position, the ith point can
     * be moved to the right by a distance of dist[i].
     * 
     * Given weight and dist, find the minimum number of operations required to sort
     * the points by their weights.
     * 
     * Function Description ðŸ¥‘
     * 
     * Complete the function getMinOperations2 in the editor -
     * 
     * GetMinOperations2 has the following arguments -
     * 
     * int weights[n]: the weights of the points
     * int dist[n]: the distances the points can move
     * Returns
     * 
     * long int: the min num of operations to sort the points.
